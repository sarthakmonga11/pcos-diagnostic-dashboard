    ### About This Dashboard

    Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in reproductive-age
    women, affecting an estimated 8–13% of this population globally — yet up to 70% of cases remain
    undiagnosed. PCOS presents heterogeneously: some patients present primarily with metabolic features
    (insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia), while others show a predominantly hormonal or
    reproductive profile (elevated androgens, anovulation, polycystic ovarian morphology). This
    variability makes early, consistent screening difficult.

    This dashboard was built to make data-driven PCOS assessment more accessible. Using a clinical
    dataset of 541 patients (177 PCOS, 364 controls) spanning 41 features — including hormonal assays,
    anthropometric measurements, ultrasound findings, and self-reported symptoms — it provides three
    complementary tools:

    - **Phenotype Explorer**: Unsupervised clustering (K-Means + PCA) to identify distinct PCOS subtypes
    - **Risk Calculator**: Logistic Regression and XGBoost models for personalized risk scoring, with both a full clinical model and a non-invasive screening model
    - **Feature Impact**: Feature importance analysis and head-to-head model comparison across algorithms and feature sets

    The non-invasive model is particularly relevant for low-resource or primary care settings, where
    laboratory tests and ultrasound may not be immediately available. It relies solely on symptoms,
    vitals, and lifestyle factors — enabling a first-pass screening without any invasive workup.

    **Dataset:** Sourced from a fertility clinic dataset, pre-processed and cleaned for analysis.
    **Methods:** K-Means clustering, logistic regression, XGBoost with RandomizedSearchCV tuning, SHAP analysis.

    st.markdown("""
    Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder affecting people of reproductive
    age, yet the average time from symptom onset to diagnosis is **2–3 years** — with many patients
    receiving incorrect or delayed diagnoses. The consequences extend well beyond reproductive health:
    PCOS is associated with elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, endometrial
    cancer, and mental health conditions including anxiety and depression.

    The clinical gold standard — the **Rotterdam Criteria** — requires at least two of three
    conditions: oligo-ovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound.
    Two of these three criteria require specialized equipment (ultrasound imaging and hormonal blood
    panels) that are costly and unavailable in many lower-resource healthcare settings. This structural
    barrier is a primary driver of underdiagnosis and motivates the search for accessible,
    symptom-based screening approaches.

with mot_col2:
    st.markdown("""
    This project is directly informed by two recent publications:

    **Agirsoy & Oehlschlaeger (2025)** demonstrated that meaningful predictive performance for PCOS
    diagnosis can be achieved using feature subsets aligned with the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria,
    supporting a feature-subset comparison approach and the use of XGBoost with SHAP interpretability.

    **Gao et al. (2025)** applied data-driven subtyping methods to a large PCOS clinical cohort,
    revealing biologically and clinically distinct subtypes across metabolic and hormonal dimensions.
    This challenges the conventional treatment of PCOS as a homogeneous condition and motivated the
    inclusion of unsupervised clustering alongside binary classification in this project.

    Together, these lines of evidence support the hypothesis that machine learning applied to
    low-cost clinical data can serve as a viable first-line screening tool, and that phenotypic
    subtyping provides additional clinical value beyond a binary prediction.

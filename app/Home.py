    ### About This Dashboard

    Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in reproductive-age
    women, affecting an estimated 8–13% of this population globally — yet up to 70% of cases remain
    undiagnosed. PCOS presents heterogeneously: some patients present primarily with metabolic features
    (insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia), while others show a predominantly hormonal or
    reproductive profile (elevated androgens, anovulation, polycystic ovarian morphology). This
    variability makes early, consistent screening difficult.

    This dashboard was built to make data-driven PCOS assessment more accessible. Using a clinical
    dataset of 541 patients (177 PCOS, 364 controls) spanning 41 features — including hormonal assays,
    anthropometric measurements, ultrasound findings, and self-reported symptoms — it provides three
    complementary tools:

    - **Phenotype Explorer**: Unsupervised clustering (K-Means + PCA) to identify distinct PCOS subtypes
    - **Risk Calculator**: Logistic Regression and XGBoost models for personalized risk scoring, with both a full clinical model and a non-invasive screening model
    - **Feature Impact**: Feature importance analysis and head-to-head model comparison across algorithms and feature sets

    The non-invasive model is particularly relevant for low-resource or primary care settings, where
    laboratory tests and ultrasound may not be immediately available. It relies solely on symptoms,
    vitals, and lifestyle factors — enabling a first-pass screening without any invasive workup.

    **Dataset:** Sourced from a fertility clinic dataset, pre-processed and cleaned for analysis.
    **Methods:** K-Means clustering, logistic regression, XGBoost with RandomizedSearchCV tuning, SHAP analysis.
